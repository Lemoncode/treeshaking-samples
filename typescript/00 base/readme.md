# Base sample

In this sample we are just creating a minimum code base (using just react and react-dom) and
adding the needed configuration to run webpack-analyzer.

Steps to play with this sample:

- First install the packages needed, run from the bash (cmd:

```bash
npm run build
```

- Second run the _run_ custom command.

```bash
npm run build
```

Automatically right after finishing with the buld process a new windows will popup and will show you the size of the bundles
clasified by packages.
